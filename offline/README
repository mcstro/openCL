Type "make" to build the byte code for multiple architectures.
Type "make clean" to nuke it all.

The Makefile was provided by a blogger (link in Makefile), whose guidance made this example possible.

Khronos does not appear to offer much guidance when it comes to offline compilation.

If Mac, you can also just copy the code right into Xcode and click the compile button. Xcode will automagically 
figure out exactly which flags to give to clang, and you can also configure them in the project's
build settings if they are not to your taste. Xcode has some real pros and cons, but I consider its behavior wrt
OpenCL to be a "pro." Then again, they might update it at some point and everything breaks.
